# Data-Structures
My code from the fall 2017 Data Structures Class at Rutgers University.


Includes four projects, each of which used structures and methds provided by the instructor:

  Big Integer:  
    Performing functions on array lists to deal with numbers larger than long integer values.
  
  Trie: 
    Creates a tree of words using their prefixes as roots, an then can search through the tree for said words.
  
  Little Search Engine: 
    Reads texts files and creates a "dictionary" with a list of words from the document, which then can be
    read and listed by frequency.
    
  Friends: 
    Analyzes an undirected and unweighted graph of people linked as friends.
